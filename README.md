# [Official] Latent-L-systems:Transformer based Tree GeneratorðŸŒ²

# Environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Data
* .lstring files are uploaded to Google Drive. Please see the urls under `data/lstrings.txt`

# Visualization
* Please refer to https://github.com/edisonlee0212/PlantArchitect

# Steps
1) First, put a folder with *.lstring files on the same directory.
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Acacia
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *.lstring
â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessing.py
```    
2) Run the Preprocessing file. It will do all the jobs. It will take about 2 hours using multi-processing with all CPUs.
```
python preprocessing.py
```
3) Training
* Set the correct file paths from Step2 in train.py Line#32, Line#36, Line#40, Line#41
```
python train.py
```
4) Inference
```
